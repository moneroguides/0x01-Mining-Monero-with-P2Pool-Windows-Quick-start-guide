00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,240
Hello and welcome to this tutorial on how 
to install P2Pool and start mining Monero.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,120
P2Pool is a decentralised pool 
which leverages a side chain  

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,840
to manage the active miners and their rewards.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,440
In order to join the Monero P2Pool all you need 
to do is run the p2pool software as well as Xmrig.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,240
Before getting started there 
are a couple of prerequisites:

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,760
Firstly you will need to have Kleopatra installed

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,240
We'll have a link for that 
down below in the description.

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,440
You'll also need a Monero wallet address.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,000
This is so P2Pool has somewhere 
to send you precious Monero.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,160
Lastly you'll need to have at 
least 50GB of free disk space.

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,640
This guide assumes no previous mining experience.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,920
If you already have xmrig and/or the 
latest version of the Monero daemon,  

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,000
you may wish to to look only at 
the P2Pool setup and skip the rest.

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,520
Before doing anything, we're 
going to create a folder called  

15
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,000
'monero-mining' in our root 
directory on the `C:` drive.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,280
We will be doing everything in 
this directory from this point on.

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,320
Windows may flag Xmrig as a 
virus in the upcoming steps,  

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,240
so we'll need to create an 
exclusion rule for the folder.

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,560
To do this we'll need to go to the 
virus and threat protection settings.

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,800
You can find this by typing it in the search bar 
or opening the start menu and typing in `virus`.

21
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,200
Next, under **Virus and 
Threat Protection Settings**,

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
click on **Manage Settings**.

23
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,280
Scroll down until you see the **Exclusions** 
Section and choose **Add or remove exclusions**.

24
00:01:50,096 --> 00:01:51,696
Click **Add an exclusion**,  

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,960
choose **folder** and then navigate to the folder 
that you just created in the root directory.

26
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,760
A link to the required installer 
for setting up your node and a  

27
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,760
connection to the P2Pool sidechain 
can be found in the description.

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,720
Once you locate the latest release,  

29
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,480
scroll down to the assets and download 
the installer, shasums and default config.

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,120
Datahoarder's public key can 
be found on each release page.

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,840
Open up a text editor and copy 
the public key into the editor.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,786
We can save it as `key.txt`.

33
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,320
Then we'll need to open Kleopatra

34
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,988
and import the key we just copied.

35
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:14,408
Be sure to use this drop-down to select **any 
files** so that you can see the `key.txt` file.  

36
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,360
There is no need to counter sign it as trusted.  

37
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,880
The important thing is to see a certificate 
which matches datahoarder's key.

38
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,600
Next we want to verify the sums file.  

39
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,086
First click on **decrypt/verify** and 
navigate to the sha file you just downloaded.

40
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,360
We can see that the name on the certificate 
matches the key that we just imported.

41
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,560
Now to check that this is in fact the file we 
to be installing and not something sinister,

42
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,760
let's go back to our `monero-mining` folder,

43
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,320
`shift + right-click`

44
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,840
and choose **open powershell here**.

45
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,856
Type `Get-Filehash`

46
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,680
and then the name of the file 
that you want to get the hash for,

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,160
which is this case is the P2Pool installer.  

48
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,200
Fortunately we don't have to type in the 
whole thing. We can just start typing  

49
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,000
"P2" and then press `TAB` and it 
will complete the filename for us.

50
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,320
Now we press `Enter`

51
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,280
and it gives us the file hash.

52
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,040
We can now open the shasum file and compare 
the hash within to the hash we just generated.

53
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,280
Simply right click and open 
with your text editor of choice.

54
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,880
We can see that this hash matches this line here.

55
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,219
Which means that we have a match 
and that the file is safe to use.

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,520
Alright, now that we've done 
that it's time to install P2Pool.

57
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,560
Right-click the install file and 
choose **Run as administrator**.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,080
Click **next** until you get to the part 
where you choose the install location.

59
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,760
Install it to the same folder 
we have been working in.

60
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,280
You'll now need a new Monero wallet address 
where you would like your mined Monero to go.

61
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,360
After the setup as finished you'll see a new 
folder here in our `monero-mining` folder,

62
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,240
you'll also see a shortcut 
has appeared on your desktop.

63
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,115
This is how we will start the P2Pool software.

64
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,320
If you've already downloaded Monero block-chain 
either because of a local node or wallet,  

65
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,320
go ahead and skip to the next section.

66
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,320
For everyone else, follow this section 
carefully and skip over the next section.

67
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,400
Before running P2Pool you will need to make 
sure you have enough space on your drive.

68
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,480
During the initial setup we will be creating 
a very large file that can easily excede 40GB.

69
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,920
If you're happy to procede then you should  

70
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,160
run P2Pool by double-clicking the 
icon that has just been created.

71
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,600
We are now syncing a database file located in 
the p2pool folder with the Monero blockchain.

72
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,600
This could take several hours so let's continue 
with the other parts of the setup in the meantime.

73
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,000
If you have followed the steps in 
this section there is no need to  

74
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,720
view the next section entitled 
**IMPORTING A PREEXISTING BLOCKCHAIN**.

75
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,841
So you can go ahead and skip over the next section 
and go straight through to setting up XMrig.

76
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,040
For those of you that already have the 
monero blockchain downloaded to you computer  

77
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,560
you will have two options.

78
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,120
The first option would be to copy or move your 
files across to the p2pool/lmdb directory.

79
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:30,249
You'll be able to find your preexisting 
lmdb folder in C:\ProgramData\bitmonero.

80
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,360
Copy or move the lmdb folder to the 
root of our current p2pool folder.

81
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,400
If you'd prefer not to move or 
copy the existing blockchain file,  

82
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,520
you can simply tell p2pool where to look for it.

83
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,240
To do this right-click the start.ps1 file,

84
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,897
choose edit,

85
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:56,428
and go to line 60.

86
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:08,768
Where it says data-dir we're going 
to change this from data-dir=. to

87
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,217
space

88
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,960
and then `data-dir C:\ProgramData\bitmonero\`

89
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,400
We can now save that and close

90
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,188
Now when we use the icon on 
the desktop to run p2pool,  

91
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,000
it will use the preexisting blockchain files.

92
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,881
This means you'll only have to wait a short 
while while it synchs the most recent blocks.

93
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,800
It's now time to install XMrig. If 
you already have this installed then  

94
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,480
feel free to skip this section.

95
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,640
Let's head over to the xmrig official 
github repository to get the latest release.

96
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,240
The link to this page can be 
found down in the description.

97
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,880
There are a lot of options here,  

98
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,960
for windows we're looking for the one 
that says gcc-win64 in the file name.

99
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,200
Don't forget to download both 
of the sums files as well.

100
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,800
For convenience, we're going to download these  

101
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,920
files to the same folder we've 
been working in up until now.

102
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,800
We're going to verify the 
download the same way as before  

103
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,000
so I'll move through this process 
a bit more quickly this time.

104
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,360
The public key for xmrig can be found in a 
different location to the files this time,

105
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,180
check the video description for the link.

106
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,920
Once again we're going to 
copy the key into a text file.  

107
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,520
We can use the same `key.txt` file from earlier.

108
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,120
Now that we've got our files and the key 
we're going to open Kleopatra once again.

109
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,892
First import the `key.txt` file.

110
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,588
No need to countersign.

111
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:17,840
Next choose **decrypt/verify** 
to verify the shasum files.

112
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,480
Finally we need to go back 
into our `monero-mining` folder  

113
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,560
and get the file hash for the 
XMRig zip that we just downloaded.

114
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,880
Once again, shift+right click

115
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,760
Open powershell window here

116
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,720
Type `Get-Filehash`

117
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,880
and then the name of the file 
you want to get the hash for.

118
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,800
This time it's the xmrig zip file,

119
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,360
remember to press TAB to autocomplete.

120
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,017
There's our hash

121
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,162
Now we can open our text editor 
and see if there's a match.

122
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,200
As we can see that there's a match between 
this line and the has that we just generated.

123
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,640
This means that the zip file is in fact 
the one we were supposed to download  

124
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,280
and it should therefore be safe to use.

125
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,120
So let's go ahead and open 
it and extract the contents.

126
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,560
Before we go any further with our XMRig 
setup, Let's check on the P2Pool software.

127
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,720
It's taken around 8 hours for it to 
sync on my machine and now that it has,  

128
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,720
it is very important to reboot.

129
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,680
You'll find a timestamp in the description  

130
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,440
so you can easily return to this 
point in the video after rebooting.

131
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,800
Welcome back.

132
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,840
To continue getting XMRig set up, 
head into the extracted folder.

133
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,400
We're going to run `benchmark_1M.cmd`,

134
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,880
let it run all the way through to 
make sure your system is stable.

135
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,640
While this is running it's a good chance 
to check that `HUGE PAGES` is enabled.

136
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,080
This is quite important and will 
really improve your hash rate.

137
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,680
If it doesn't say `permission granted` there'll be  

138
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,840
a link down in the description 
to help you solve this problem.

139
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,600
Once that's complete your 
hashrate can be found here.

140
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,752
Mine says 2157h/s.

141
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,960
Take note of your hashrate as 
you'll need it in just a moment.

142
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,080
To make sure XMRig is using the 
correct configuration when it runs,  

143
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,640
datahoarder has kindly put one together for us.

144
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,560
It's the config.json file we downloaded earlier.

145
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,040
But we need to make one slight 
tweak before we continue.

146
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,931
In the user section we curently have "x+600000".

147
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,320
We should replace that number with 
one equal to 30x your hash rate.

148
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,960
For example my hashrate was 2157,

149
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,280
so I multiply that by 30

150
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,360
and I would put this number 64710 over here.

151
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,440
We can now move this file into the xmrig folder.

152
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,840
Replace the file in the destination.

153
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,987
Let's also create a shortcut for 
xmrig and place it on the desktop.

154
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,520
Alright, it's finally time 
to get our mining underway.

155
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,080
So let's open p2pool by 
clicking on the desktop icon.

156
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,400
We need to wait for it to finish 
synchronising before we open XMRig.

157
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,648
You will know it's synched once you start 
receiving block templates and see `depth = 0`.

158
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:02,362
Finally we can run XMRig.

159
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,600
Make sure you do this as an administrator.

160
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,480
Otherwise you'll see this 
`FAILED TO APPLY MSR MOD` error.

161
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,600
This will negatively impact your 
hashrate and quite significantly.

162
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,240
Again, do make sure that `HUGE 
PAGES` says `permission granted`.

163
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,262
If it doesn't, check the link 
in the description for help.

164
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,840
To check that all you've done is actually 
paying off, there's a few things you can do.

165
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,400
Firstly, xmrig should be recieving 
jobs from your local ip address.

166
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,920
Secondly you can use console commands 
when in the p2pool terminal window.

167
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,520
`status` will print the status of the side 
chain, your stratum server and the p2pserver.

168
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,680
If everything went well you should see at least 
1 connection under the stratumserver subheading.

169
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,400
It should also report your estimated hash rate.

170
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:05,040
As p2pool uses a pplns system you are 
only paid for your effort if you have  

171
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,680
a share in this window when a block is minted.

172
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,560
For more information about PPLNS,  

173
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,000
please read the blog post by NiceHash 
linked below in the comments.

174
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,000
Under the sidechain heading you will see 
the number of shares you've submitted and  

175
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,840
an approximation of the reward you will 
receive once a block has been minted.

176
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,280
As we haven't submitted any shares this 
session there is no information available.

177
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,520
Other commands can be found by typing `help`.

178
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,080
For example you can set `loglevel` 
which will change how much is being  

179
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,360
logged out if you find the 
interface a bit too crowded.

180
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,080
Log level 2 is a comfortable 
setting for most people.

181
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,207
To set it you can simply type 
`loglevel 2` and hit enter.

182
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,800
There are two big incentives 
for miners to join p2pool.

183
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,920
First is the low payout threshold and 0% fees.

184
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,600
The other is the ability to sign 
up to the xmrvsbeast raffle.

185
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,840
If it's your first time hearig about the 
xmrvsbeast raffle, here's what you need to know.

186
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,720
The raffle exists to incentivise miners, 
especially those with low hashrates.

187
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,160
It currently does so by pointing large amounts of  

188
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,080
hashing power to your node 
for a given period of time.

189
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,080
It started quite recently at the beggining of 2021  

190
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,840
and was set up by an 
anonymous group or individual.

191
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:49,520
They started by setting up their own 
pool but with the advent of the P2Pool,  

192
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,920
the xmrvsbeast pool was closed and all the 
incentives moved to the P2Pool network.

193
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,080
If you would like to take part in the raffle,  

194
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,240
the next part of the video covers 
port forwarding for this purpose.

195
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,680
In order for the hashing power 
of xmrvsbeast to reach your node  

196
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,200
you will need to open up your 
stratum server to the world.

197
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,240
Port forwarding can be a tricky business,  

198
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,960
but in general both your router and your 
computer need to have this port forwarded.

199
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,720
Since every router is different, we wont' be 
covering port forwarding on routers in this video.

200
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:32,295
But for Windows, here's what we need to do:

201
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,800
Open the Windows start menu and 
begin typing the word "Firewall".

202
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,480
It should be the first result.  

203
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,880
Once here, click on **Advanced 
Settings** then choose **Inbound Rules**.

204
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,680
Create a new rule.

205
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,120
This rule is for a port.

206
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,760
Click Next.

207
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,880
We want TCP

208
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,360
and then the port number which is 3333.

209
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,280
Allow the connection.

210
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,280
Finally, click next

211
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,360
give it a name, I'll be calling 
it stratum, and that's it.

212
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,120
We've opened port 3333 which is the default 
port of your default Stratum server.

213
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:29,280
It's also recommended to open ports 18080 
(Monero daemon) and 37889 (P2Pool Peer Network)

214
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,560
for better connectivity with 
the rest of the network.

215
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,640
Although this is not mandatory.

216
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,880
Once you have the correct port forwarded

217
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,840
you'll need to head on over to the 
xmrvsbeast website linked in the description.

218
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,720
At the bottom of the landing page 
you'll find some useful links.

219
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,080
The first is the boost dashboard. 
As well as a raffle, there is also  

220
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,160
a boost system which provides bonus hashrate 
to miners sequentially rather than randomly.

221
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,280
So regardless of your luck you can always 
expect a little boost from time to time.

222
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,360
The second link explains in more 
detail the rules of the raffle  

223
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,240
and provides a page to register which 
we will be heading to in a moment.

224
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,160
As well as a page for viewing your 
history as a raffle participant.

225
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,363
Select register/update.

226
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,760
This is where you enter the 
information required to find your node.

227
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,480
This includes your monero address 
which is used to manage the raffle,  

228
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,400
your public ip address and 
the port you have forwarded.

229
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,120
The token field should be left 
blank for new registrations.

230
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,400
If you don't know your public ip address 
you can find it using the powershell  

231
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,400
and the command `ipconfig` or you can 
more simply check on a 3rd party site.

232
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:03,360
The websites of vpn providers such as mullvad 
or nordvpn are great for this purpose.

233
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,760
A successful registration 
should look something like this.

234
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,600
Write down your token, this is important.

235
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,720
We can check double check 
our registration has been  

236
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,000
successful by heading over to the history page

237
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
and entering our XMR address and 
the token we were issued with.

238
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,514
If you have any troubles with this 
step please head over to the xmrvsbeast                           

239
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,520
subreddit and search for 
similar issues before posting.

240
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,640
A link to this can be found in the description.

241
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:46,880
You can easily check your progress remotely 
by visiting https://p2pool.observer/

242
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,160
Here you can use your monero address to 
search and find your individual progress.

243
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:56,156
As we're new to mining we'll get an error.

244
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:02,480
Only once you have begun finding shares will you 
see information about your miner and its progress.

245
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,920
To find out how often you may produce shares,

246
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,880
head back to the main page and select 
the average share time calculator,

247
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,000
punch in your hashrate and 
you'll receive an estimate.

248
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,400
Let's take a look at another 
miners progress to see an example.

249
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,160
Here you can see statistics from 
the miner including average effort,

250
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,960
blocks found and share positions.

251
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,240
Here the shares move from right to left 
with time unlike the p2pool program.

252
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,440
Below this you will see 
information about each payout  

253
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,916
and the shares which enabled 
those payouts at the bottom.

254
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,520
This pool is only possible because 
of the hard work of contributors.  

255
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,760
The main repository for p2pool can 
be found in the description below.

256
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,080
If you're interested to know more 
about it's features and how it works,  

257
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,680
including how to set things up on a different OS,

258
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,156
this is the place to come.

259
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,440
And at the bottom of this page 
you will find a donation address.

260
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,360
The people who work on these things do 
it mostly for love rather than money,  

261
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,480
so every donation goes to keeping them motivated.

262
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,356
Well, that's all for this video. Thanks 
so much for watching and happy mining.

263
00:22:20,462 --> 00:22:22,369
